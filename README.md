# lauzhack2022 - Sign transcription

Our project is to developp an application that can be adapted to a plugin for Teams, Meet, Discord, kMeet or other videoconferencing software.

Our objective is to help deaf people to follow a videoconference by transcribing the sign language to text on camera or to the chat.
